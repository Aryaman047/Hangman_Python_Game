# Hangman_Python_Game
A small Python Game created by ARYAMAN ADIVYA SINGH just to better understand the basic concepts of Python

Hangman is a popular word guessing game where the player attempts to build a missing word by guessing one letter at a time. After a certain number of incorrect guesses( 7 to be precise), the game ends and the player loses. The game also ends if the player correctly identifies all the letters of the missing word.

The game is designed so as to provide an interactive experience and can be run easily on lightest of IDE's with responsive effects.

Download the files - Hangman.py , words.py and corncob_caps.txt and place it in a same file to play the game
Will be updating the game anytime a new idea pops in.
